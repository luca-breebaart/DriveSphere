#Drivesphere Website
This is a website that allows users to search for cars and compare their specifications. It includes three pages: Home, Compare, and Timeline.

#Home Page
The home page provides an overview of the website and its features. It includes a header with a navigation bar, a logo, and an image. There is also a description of the Car Specs API, which is used to access a vast database of car details.

The page includes a search form, where users can select a make, model, and year to find a car. There is also a section with an image and text encouraging users to find the best car for them and to compare cars.

Finally, the page includes a footer with the Drivesphere copyright notice and links to the website's social media pages.

#Compare Page

Users can select a car make, model, generation, and trim using dropdown menus.
When a user adds a car, the technical specifications and dimensions of that car are displayed in a card.
Users can remove a car from the comparison by clicking a "Remove" button in the card.
The comparison card also includes three charts:
A bar chart showing city, highway, and combined fuel economy for the selected car.
A pie chart showing the length, width, and height of the selected car.
A polar area chart showing the number of cylinders, gears, and valves per cylinder for the selected car.

#Timeline Page

The user can select a car make, model, generation, and trim, and the application retrieves the car's specifications from the API and displays them in a graph format using Chart.js. The Web page also allows the user to switch between the different graphs and view different car models by selecting different options from the dropdown menus. The goal of this application is to provide users with an easy way to compare and visualize the specifications of different car models.
